---+ E/gamma Exercise 1: General Introduction

The goal of this exercise is to gain some basic familarity with accessing E/gamma objects in the CMSSW framework. We will mix python and c++ techiques, python in general is faster and easier to investigate things while c++ can be faster and more robust. 
In general the two approaches share many common elements and leasons learnt in one can carry other to the other

---++ Environment Setup

Login to lxplus slc6 machine

<verbatim>
ssh -XY your_username@lxplus6.cern.ch
</verbatim>

First we need to setup a CMSSW environment. In your working area

<verbatim>
cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_10
cd CMSSW_10_2_10/src/
cmsenv
git cms-init
#generic e/gamma requirents for updating the miniAOD
git cms-merge-topic cms-egamma:EgammaPostRecoTools
git cms-merge-topic cms-egamma:PhotonIDValueMapSpeedup1029
git cms-merge-topic cms-egamma:slava77-btvDictFix_10210
git cms-addpkg EgammaAnalysis/ElectronTools
rm EgammaAnalysis/ElectronTools/data -rf
git clone https://github.com/cms-data/EgammaAnalysis-ElectronTools.git EgammaAnalysis/ElectronTools/data
#now we add in our POS tools
git clone git@github.com:cms-egamma/EgCMSPOS2019.git
scram b -j 8
</verbatim>


---++ Basic Familarisation of E/gamma Objects (miniAOD)

We will use miniAOD first as its the most common POG dataformat while having nice embedded information for analysis. First start a python interactive environment. 

<verbatim>
python -i EgCMSPOS2019/EgammaAnalysis/test/exercise1a.py /eos/cms/store/group/phys_egamma/CMSPOS2019/DYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8__RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD__102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1__MINIAODSIM__F1B849B9-9B5D-1041-B5CD-73DB6C24072A.root
</verbatim>

Now we can interactively investigate electron and photon objects. First we need a "handle" to access the electron and photon collections. The electron and photon handles have already been created in the code, all we have to do is set them to point to the correct location. As a side note, a handle is just a term for class which allows us to retreive the product data and effectively acts like a c++ pointer (and is one under the hood..).

First we need to load the event we wish investigate. 
<verbatim>
events.to(0) #the entry in the file of the event we wish to go to
</verbatim>

Now we get set the handles to the electron/photon collections
<verbatim>
events.getByLabel(ele_label,eles_handle)
events.getByLabel(pho_label,phos_handle)
</verbatim>

Now to access the correct collections themselves
<verbatim>
eles = eles_handle.product()
phos = phos_handle.product()
</verbatim>

This is a collection of eles and photons in the event. eles[0] is the first electron in the event, eles[1] is the second and so on (and likewise for photons). 

Lets access an electron

<verbatim>
ele = eles[0]
</verbatim>

now we can play around with its varibles
<verbatim>
ele.energy()
ele.superCluster().energy()
ele.superCluster().rawEnergy()
ele.eta()
ele.phi()
</verbatim>
and so on. We can also access the pat::Electron specific userdata say, lets see if we pass the medium ID

<verbatim>
ele.electronID("cutBasedElectronID-Fall17-94X-V2-medium")
</verbatim>

We can also look at the userInt and userFloat data as well as ID variables
<verbatim>
ele.full5x5_sigmaIetaIeta()
ele.deltaEtaSeedClusterTrackAtVtx()
ele.userFloat("heepTrkId")
ele.userInt("")
</verbatim>

Note at any time if you want to see what userdata is stored in the electron/photon, pass an empty string to userFloat, userInt, electronID/photonID functions. An exception will occur and it'll show you which ones are active. Note: dont do this in c++! or in an event loop, this is just for interactively investigating things in python. 

*exercise 1.1*: play around the code and access a few id variables. 

---++ Plotting Variables

Interactively looking at individual electrons is find to get a feeling but its not very useful for analysis. So lets make some histograms! We have now added an event loop to our example python script and some histograms to plot.

<verbatim>
python -i EgCMSPOS2019/EgammaAnalysis/test/exercise1b.py /eos/cms/store/group/phys_egamma/CMSPOS2019/DYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8__RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD__102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1__MINIAODSIM__F1B849B9-9B5D-1041-B5CD-73DB6C24072A.root
</verbatim>

*exercise 1.2*:
plot the sigmaIEtaIEta histogram

*exercise 1.3*:
add a histogram of hadem

[You can browse the following codes to know how to access hadem (H/E): 
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DataFormats/EgammaCandidates/interface/GsfElectron.h, 
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DataFormats/EgammaCandidates/interface/Photon.h]

*exercise 1.4*:
require the objects entering the histograms to pass the medium ID. Compare the histograms to the orginal inclusive histograms, what do you notice?

---++ Updating User Information

E/gamma objects are created at reconstruction time with a fixed release. This means that developments which come after the release is made are not present in the electrons/photons. Most commonly theres are new ids and residual energy corrections which often depend on the release to exist first. 

E/gamma has a tool which re-runs all the latest corrections and puts them in pat::Electron, pat::Photon, EgammaPostRecoTools. In framework lite, which is what was underlying our python adventures, we can not run these tools so we have two options
   * make a copy of the miniAOD but with updated collections and run on that
   * run in the full framework and and use these tools to make the updated correction on the fly

We will now show both approaches. They both have their advantages and disadvantages. The first option is not very practical for diskspace reasons and means in effect you would need to rewait for a "re-miniAOD" which happen about once a year. The second option is much more convenient but requires us to get our hands dirty with c++. 


---+++ Generating Updated MiniAOD

E/gamma maintains a set of recipes and tools to do this. The full, up-to-date instructions can be found at [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/EgammaPostRecoRecipes][EgammaPostRecoRecipes]]. They are breifly summarised below:

The tool to update e/gamma objects is "EgammaPostRecoTools" and consists of adding three lines to your CMSSW config. 

<verbatim>
from RecoEgamma.EgammaTools.EgammaPostRecoTools import setupEgammaPostRecoSeq
setupEgammaPostRecoSeq(process,era='2018-Prompt')  
#a sequence egammaPostRecoSeq has now been created and should be added to your path, eg process.p=cms.Path(process.egammaPostRecoSeq)
</verbatim>

So lets make some new miniAOD with all the latest and greatest IDs and scale factors! There is an example script in EgammaPostRecoTools which does this for us [[https://github.com/cms-egamma/cmssw/blob/EgammaPostRecoTools/RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/runEgammaPostRecoTools.py][RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/runEgammaPostRecoTools.py]]. It simply does the above three lines as well as setting up the input and output modules standard to any CMSSW job. Lets run it

<verbatim>
cmsRun RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/runEgammaPostRecoTools.py inputFiles=file:/eos/cms/store/group/phys_egamma/CMSPOS2019/DYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8__RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD__102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1__MINIAODSIM__F1B849B9-9B5D-1041-B5CD-73DB6C24072A.root outputFile=dyToEE_newMiniAOD.root maxEvents=1000 era=2018-Prompt
</verbatim>

We have now produced a new miniAOD file with updated electrons and photons. 

Lets look at the content of the file
<verbatim>
edmDumpEventContent dyToEE_newMiniAOD_numEvent1000_EDM.root
</verbatim>

Compare this to the original miniAOD file and you will see we have two new collections called slimmedElectrons and slimmedPhotons but now with the process EGAMMA not PAT. This means when you access slimmedElectrons/slimmedPhotons without specifying a process, it picks up the most recent one , in this case our new EGAMMA one. 

So if we go back exercise 1.1 using this new file, we'll now be able to access different user content without changing our script. For example we have now have access to the scales & smearings and photon V2 IDs. 

You can see the user content embbed in an electron / photon via the script:
[[https://github.com/cms-egamma/cmssw/blob/EgammaPostRecoTools/RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/printEgammaUserData.py][RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/printEgammaUserData.py]]

Try it and compare the content for the orginal file and our new file:
<verbatim>
python RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/printEgammaUserData.py /eos/cms/store/group/phys_egamma/CMSPOS2019/DYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8__RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD__102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1__MINIAODSIM__F1B849B9-9B5D-1041-B5CD-73DB6C24072A.root
python RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/printEgammaUserData.py dyToEE_newMiniAOD_numEvent1000_EDM.root
</verbatim>


---+++ Ntuplising inside full CMSSW framework

We will use the ggAnalysis code to do Option 2 for us and produce ntuples from the objects we have been using. This will be signficantly faster as we dont need to write the new collection to disk. Note this is maintained by cmkuo at [[https://github.com/cmkuo/ggAnalysis.git][this location] but we will use a forked version to add additional info needed for these tutorials

In our $CMSSW_BASE/src directory
<verbatim>
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/
git cms-merge-topic cms-met:METFixEE2017_949_v2_backport_to_102X
git clone https://github.com/cmkuo/HiggsAnalysis.git
git clone -b 102X-egpos2019 https://github.com/cms-egamma/ggAnalysis.git #fork of https://github.com/cmkuo/ggAnalysis.git
scram b -j 8
</verbatim>

Check what the ntuplizer is doing for electrons in [[https://github.com/cms-egamma/ggAnalysis/blob/102X-egpos2019/ggNtuplizer/plugins/ggNtuplizer_electrons.cc][ggAnalysis/ggNtuplizer/plugins/ggNtuplizer_electrons.cc]] and for photons in [[https://github.com/cms-egamma/ggAnalysis/blob/102X-egpos2019/ggNtuplizer/plugins/ggNtuplizer_photons.cc][ggAnalysis/ggNtuplizer/plugins/ggNtuplizer_photons.cc]]. Look at the following snippet from ggNtuplizer_electrons.cc,

<img alt="eleCode.png" height="547" src="%ATTACHURL%/eleCode.png" title="eleCode.png" width="938" />

You can see that:
   * some quanties are taken from the electron directly, e.g. iEle-&gt;charge()
   * some are taken from the referenced GsfTrack, e.g. iEle-&gt;gsfTrack()-&gt;dz(pv)
   * some are taken from the referenced ECAL SuperCluster, e.g. iEle-&gt;superCluster()-&gt;energy()
   * some are floats which are done at the MINIAOD production level, e.g. iEle-&gt;userFloat("ecalEnergyPostCorr")

All this is completely analogous to we were doing in our interactive python session, its the same function names which return the same results. However you may notice that we now sometimes swap "." for "-&gt;", for example in python we had "superCluster().energy()" and now in c++ we have "superCluster()-&gt;energy()". This because c++ has the concept of "pointers" for which "-&gt;" means "access the method of the object we are pointing to" while python everything is a reference variable. Depending on your level of c++ knowledge, this will either make complete or no sense to you. Dont worry, it'll become clear in time if it isnt already.


<!--For acceptance or efficiency studies it is better to use the electron supercluster eta, while for momentum estimation for electrons one needs to use the electron eta directly, coming from the track (they are different since supercluster eta is a geometric quantity related to position of the cluster, while electron eta depends on the track direction and is also more precise).-->

Now run the ntuplizer on a root file from the 2018D rereco dataset /EGamma/Run2018D-PromptReco-v2/MINIAOD.

<verbatim>
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/ggAnalysis/ggNtuplizer/test
</verbatim>

Now open run_data2018_102X.py, and put one root file as input, for example this one:

[[https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?view=list&limit=50&instance=prod%2Fglobal&input=file%3D%2Fstore%2Fdata%2FRun2018D%2FEGamma%2FMINIAOD%2FPromptReco-v2%2F000%2F322%2F252%2F00000%2FCEA0CEC1-E9B3-E811-921F-FA163E9182E7.root][/store/data/Run2018D/EGamma/MINIAOD/PromptReco-v2/000/322/252/00000/CEA0CEC1-E9B3-E811-921F-FA163E9182E7.root]] which we have copied to  /eos/cms/store/group/phys_egamma/CMSPOS2019/EGamma_Run2018D_MINIAOD_322252_CEA0CEC1-E9B3-E811-921F-FA163E9182E7.root for your convenience. 

Now invoke the proxy

<verbatim>
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
</verbatim>

<verbatim>
cmsRun run_data2018_102X.py
</verbatim>

Open ggtree_data.root, and have a close look.

<verbatim>
root -l ggtree_data.root
ggNtuplizer->cd()
EventTree->Print()
EventTree->Draw("nEle")
EventTree->Draw("eleR9","eleR9>0")
EventTree->Draw("eleHoverE")
EventTree->Draw("eleSigmaIEtaIEtaFull5x5")
</verbatim>

Now run on simulated sample, which is enriched in real electron. This dataset is suitable:

/DYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8/RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD-102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1/MINIAODSIM

Take one root file from this dataset, for example this one:

[[https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?input=file%3D%2Fstore%2Fmc%2FRunIIAutumn18MiniAOD%2FDYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8%2FMINIAODSIM%2F102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1%2F00000%2FF1B849B9-9B5D-1041-B5CD-73DB6C24072A.root&instance=prod/global][/store/mc/RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD/DYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8/MINIAODSIM/102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1/00000/F1B849B9-9B5D-1041-B5CD-73DB6C24072A.root]]

We have put this at /eos/cms/store/group/phys_egamma/CMSPOS2019/DYToEE_M-50_NNPDF31_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8__RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD__102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1__MINIAODSIM__F1B849B9-9B5D-1041-B5CD-73DB6C24072A.root for your convenience (yes you guessed it, it was the file we used earlier)

Put this root file in run_mc2018_102X.py, and run it .

Take a look at output root file, ggtree_mc.root

<verbatim>
root -l ggtree_mc.root
ggNtuplizer->cd()
EventTree->Print()
EventTree->Draw("nEle")
EventTree->Draw("eleR9","eleR9>0")
EventTree->Draw("eleHoverE")
EventTree->Draw("eleSigmaIEtaIEtaFull5x5")
</verbatim>

<br>%ICON{led-green}% Question: Why there are two peaks in eleSigmaIEtaIEtaFull5x5 plot?

Also check the isolation variables:

<verbatim>
EventTree->Draw("elePFChIso")
EventTree->Draw("elePFNeuIso")
</verbatim>
