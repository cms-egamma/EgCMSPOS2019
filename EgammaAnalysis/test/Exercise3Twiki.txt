---+ Exercise 4: Electron/Photon Energy Measurements

This exercise will teach you about e/gamma energies estimates in CMS.

Before starting this exercise, we will need to update our code. In your $CMSSW_BASE/src/EgCMSPOS2019 directory please do a "git pull" to get the latest version. 

---++ Energy Measurements
An electrons energy is measured by the calorimeter while its momentum is measured by the tracker. As electrons have to have at least 4 GeV of energy in CMS, the 0.511 MeV mass of the electron can be safely neglected and we can take the electrons energy to be equal to its momentum. A photon has no track so only its energy can be measured.

Like always, we will focus on the electrons as given they have a track they are the more interesting of the two oobjects.  

---++ ECAL Energy Measurement
As we discussed previously, individual energy deposits in the calorimeter are summed into clusters of hits (PFClusters) and then those clusters are clustered into SuperClusters to represent the initial electron before undergoing showering. Lets look into some energy measurements

First we will investigate the energy of the resolution of just summing directly the ECAL energy deposits (rec-hits). We will do this first for the seed cluster and the supercluster and compare them to the true energy of the electron (which we know as this is Monte Carlo simulation).

<verbatim>
eleSCRawEn_         .push_back(iEle->superCluster()->rawEnergy());
eleSeedRawEn_.push_back(iEle->superCluster()->seed()->energy());	
</verbatim>

<br />%ICON{led-green}% Question: Plot the ratio of each raw energy to the true or gen energy of the electron. What do you notice about this? How does the supercluster energy compare to the seed cluster energy?

Lets quantify the performance and fit a resolution function. There are two functions we fit, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ball_function][crystall ball function]] a double sided crystal ball function and Cruijff function. These functions are not simple Gausians due to radiative tails of the electron. 

We will use roofit to fit the distribution, similar to your pre-exercises. However I've written [[https://github.com/cms-egamma/EgCMSPOS2019/blob/master/EgammaAnalysis/src/ResFitter.cc#L77-L118][some code to do this for us]]. Have a look at the function, it should all look very familar. 
 
<verbatim>
dyTree2018 = HistFuncs::makeChain("ggNtuplizer/EventTree","/eos/cms/store/group/phys_egamma/CMSPOS2019/ntuples/GGNtupV2/MINIAODSIM/DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8/102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1_MINIAODSIM_GGNtupV2/190915_203701/0000/DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8_ntuples_102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1_GGNtupV2_*",10)
hist = HistFuncs::makeHist(dyTree2018,100,0,2,"eleSCRawEn/eleGenEn","eleRegion==0 && eleGenEn>0 && eleGenEn>30 && eleGenEn<40")
ResFitter fitter;
fitResDCB = fitter.makeDCBFit(hist,0.5,1.5)
fitResDCB.plot->Draw()
</verbatim>

<verbatim>
we can also compare to a Cruijff function
fitResDCB = fitter.makeCruijffFit(hist,0.5,1.5)
fitResDCB.plot->Draw()
</verbatim>

That was just for the barrel. You can make a histogram for different eta or gen et cuts to see how it changes. Also applying a selection to it.

Finally it is useful to see where we have poor energy loss so we can better understand. Lets make our favourite $eta-phi$ plot for electrons whos supercluster energy recoed only 90% or less of its true energy for electrons with eleGenEn>30 GeV.
<verbatim>
dyTree2018->Draw("eleSCPhi:eleSCEta","eleSCRawEn/eleGenEn<0.9 && eleGenEn>0 && eleGenEn>30")
<verbatim>


---++ ECAL Energy Corrections

As you have no doubt seen from exercise1, just taking our perfectly calibrated ecal energy deposits and summing them up is not giving the precision we need. 

There are many ways the energy of the electron in the ecal can not end up absorbed in the ECAL. For example, we apply noise cuts on the ECAL rec-hits to enter PF clusters. Anything below that threshold is simply discarded meaning we will recover less of the electrons energy. 

<br>%ICON{led-green}% Question: what other mechanisms lead to an incorrect measurement of energy ?

How we address this is we use a semi-parametric boosted decision tree (BDT) trained on a sample of electrons and photons to estimate 

There are three ecal energy corrections
   * PF ECAL cluster correction: 
      * these are basic corrections which correct a given PF cluster to the response expected if it were a single em particle. Mostly corrects for ECAL rec-hit thresholds. 
      * the refined supercluster's energy the sum of corrected energy of its consistuent PF clusters
   * Mustache super cluster correction:
      * applies to the mustache superclusters. You can safely ignore for now, in analysis you will always work with refined superclusters and this is only mentioned for completeness
   * Electron / Photon correction:
      * applied on top of the refined supercluster energy of the electron/photon. Note, it is not stored in the supercluster itself but as the ecal energy of the electron/photon
      * electrons & photons have seperately trained corrections
      * this is the energy you will use and it represents the best possible correction

 
Before we look at these variables we will first understand how they are produced. We use the following package: [[https://github.com/cms-egamma/EgRegresTrainerLegacy][EgRegreTrainerLegacy]] although we want to move towards more sophisicated tools such as Keras. A good talk on the subject is by Josh Bendavid is linked [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/306030/contributions/704007/attachments/582222/801455/egmGED-reg-Mar24-2014.pdf]]. It produces a gradient boosted decision forest based on [[https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_10_6_2/RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins/EGRegressionModifierV3.cc#L224-L272][many input parameters]]. 

Now lets make an energy correction! We will use a specially skimmed ntuple to speed things up. This only has real electron in it (eleGenEn>0 cut)

So what we know from our investigations is that the scale will be different in different regions of the detector. So we what we need to do is group together electrons with a similar scale and correct them so their scale is 1.  An example. Lets consider barrel electrons in two areas of the calorimeter. We know iEta==25 is a gap where we lose energy. So lets compare it to iEta==30 where we have a good measurement esimate.

<verbatim>
histIEta25Or30 = HistFuncs::makeHist(dyTree2018,100,0,2,"eleSCRawEn/eleGenEn","eleGenEn>0 && eleGenEn>30 && eleRegion==0 && (eleIEtaOrX==25 || eleIEtaOrX==30)")

</verbatim>




We will now look at the corrected energy variables 
<verbatim>
eleSeedCorrEn_      .push_back(iEle->superCluster()->seed()->correctedEnergy());
eleSCEn_            .push_back(iEle->superCluster()->energy());
eleEcalEn_          .push_back(iEle->ecalEnergy()); 
</verbatim>

The first is the seed cluster corrected energy, the second is the supercluster corrected energy (which is the sum of the seed cluster corrected energies) and the final is the fully corrected energy of the supercluster which is known as the electrons ecal energy. Note if this was a photon "ecalEnergy" would just be "energy" 

<br />%ICON{led-green}% Question: plot all these variables (with the raw energy for comparison). What do you notice?

---++ Tracker Momentum Measurements

As, for our purposes, the electron can be assumed as massless, the tracker gives a second measurement of the electrons energy. Lets look at our two momentum measurements, the momentum as measured at the inner most layer of the track (p_in) and the momentum measured at the outer most layer of the tracker (p_out).

<verbatim>
eleGsfTrkPInn_.push_back(iEle->trackMomentumAtVtx().r());
eleGsfTrkPOut_.push_back(iEle->trackMomentumOut().r());
</verbatim>

<br />%ICON{led-green}% Question: now plot these variables, what do you notice? Compare the inner momentum resolution to the ecal energy for  10 <genPt<15 GeV and 30<genPt<50. Which is better for which energy range?


---++ Track-ECAL combination

The tracker and ECAL have complimentary measurements of the electrons energy so we can combine these them to improve the resolution. This is done by doing a standard error weighted combination of the two measurements and then correcting it via a further energy correction similar to what we did for the calorimeter only energy. 

This energy is what is stored as the electrons energy and is accessed by 
<verbatim>
eleEn_              .push_back(iEle->energy());
</verbatim>
It is also equivalent to "p4().E()"

<br />%ICON{led-green}% Question: now plot the full ECAL-Trk combined energy and the ECAL only energy. Compare in the ranges of 10 <genPt<15 GeV and 30<genPt<50 as before. Which is better for which energy range?

---++ Residual Energy corrections

If we only used Monte Carlo simulation, the ECAL-Track or ECAL-only energy would be all we need. However we are experimentalists and we want to use real data! And we want our MC simulatation to match that data, particulary the energy scale. In the ECAL short exercise, our ECAL friends described how the calibrate data, however those calibrations are imperfect for various reasons leading to data having a slighly different energy scale and resolution to Monte Carlo. Additionally there is another effect from the fact the data is imperfectly simulated and applying a correction based on MC to the data can lead to a small miss-calibration. Therefore to solve both these effects derrive residual energy corrections (also known as scale& smearing) to calibrate the data to the MC and ensure the Monte Carlo resolution matches that of the data. 
 
The size of the residual energy corrections is directly related to how good the calibration of the ECAL at the time of the reconstruction of the data are.  Calibrating a detector is a time consuming task requring significant amounts of data so initial calibrations tend to require significant residual corrections while re-recos often require neglible corrections.  Therefore it is extremely important to use the residual corrections appripriate to your data/MC combination. 

The residual corrections consist of a scale correction for data and a resolution correction for Monte Carlo. The data scale is corrected back to the MC scale while the Monte Carlo energy is smeared to match the data resolution.  The data scale corrections are currently binned in run nr (as the scale can shift over the course of the year), eta (different parts of the ECAL may be calibrated with different precision), r9 (data and simulation may have slightly different responses to material effects) and gain (different ecal gains may have different responses). The smearing corrections are binned in eta. 

The residual corrections are derived using the Z peak, with the peak position setting the data scale correction and the peak width setting the extra smearing needed for MC. Note, it is intentional that the MC always has a slightly better resolution than in data. Question why do you think we do that?

Note these corrections are applied to the ECAL energy only as they are to account for ECAL energy discrepances. The ECAL only energy is then recombined with the tracker momentum to give the ECAL-Track combined energy

The corrected energies are then stored as
<verbatim>
eleCalibEcalEn_         .push_back(iEle->userFloat("ecalEnergyPostCorr"));
eleCalibEn_             .push_back(iEle->userFloat("ecalTrkEnergyPostCorr"));
</verbatim>

Lets first have a look at them and how they differ to their uncorrected values. Plot eleCalibEcalEn/eleEcalEn and eleCalibEn/eleEn for both data and MC. What do you notice? Can you explain the differences?
     
Now lets compare data and MC. To do this we will use a new set of ntuples to simplify things. These ntuples are generated from our ggNtuples but instead of each branch being a vector of entries with each entry corresponding to a given electron, we now have single entry branches corresponding to ele1 and ele2, our first and second electron in a pair plus a mass. This makes it much easier and faster to compare a mass spectrum. Now our branch names are different, instead of "eleX" its "ele1X" and "ele2X". Each event can have multiple entries in the tree such that all possible electron pairs are represented. 




Finally lets understand what the error on the energy is. Naively, one would assume that correctedEcalEnergyError() or p4Error() would return the error on the energy. However this is not quite correct. This value is actually sigma_DCB as estimated by our BDT. So it gives a resonable estimate of the resolution as long as it is relatively small. Once it becomes large (>5% of the ecal energy) it is effectively a random number which tells you "this electron is poorly measured".

The energy on the electron scale is actually from the scale and smearing and is a measure of how confident we are that we have calibrated the energy. A discussion of the energy scale uncertainties can be found here [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/EgammaMiniAODV2#Energy_Scale_and_Smearing][EgammaMiniAODV2#Energy_Scale_and_Smearing]]. We have eleScale_stat_up, eleScale_stat_dn, eleScale_syst_up, eleScale_syst_dn, eleScale_gain_up and eleScale_gain_dn. Of these values, the stat error is neglible, the gain error is only important for >100 GeV (and really only >300GeV) so we will focus on the syst error. 

You can now scale the data up and down by syst error
