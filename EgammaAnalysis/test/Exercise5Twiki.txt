---+ Exercise 5: Electron MVA ID training

(Many thanks to Jonas Rembser for preparing this tutorial)

You will mainly follow the instructions from here https://github.com/guitargeek/ElectronMVATutorial

Some tips, suggestions and explanations are given below:

Here you will use XGBoost for training. 
XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and it is an open-source software library.
The reasons to use XGBoost are :
Execution Speed and Model Performance.

Read more from here: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
and this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754

In the ntuplizing step, you can use this root file:

<verbatim>
/store/mc/Run3Summer19MiniAOD/DYJets_incl_MLL-50_TuneCP5_14TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8/MINIAODSIM/2023Scenario_106X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v3-v1/270000/222889F5-1E13-F34C-B312-B9B102119CBB.root
</verbatim>

Use all events from this root file so that you have enough events for training.

Once you have the ntuple, you will switch to SWAN notebook to work there. The notebook is available here:
https://github.com/guitargeek/ElectronMVATutorial/blob/master/ElectronMVATutorial.ipynb
but you need to open it from SWAN.

In the first block, you should put your own CERN username.

<verbatim>
username = "your_username"
</verbatim>

In the next block, before importing uproot you need to install it, which is done like this:

<verbatim>
!pip install --user uproot
</verbatim>

Comment out the line 
<verbatim>
ls /eos/user/....
</verbatim>

Copy the ntuple you produced in your eos area. For example, I have it here:
<verbatim>
/eos/user/s/swmukher/electron_ntuple.root
</verbatim>

Your code should point to your ntuple location, for example,
<verbatim>
root_files = glob.glob("/eos/user/s/swmukher/electron_ntuple.root")
</verbatim>

In the last step you will see that the ROC curves are not smooth. This is because of low statistics in ntuple.
