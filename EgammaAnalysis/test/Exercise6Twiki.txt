---+ Exercise 6: Electron and Photon Triggers (Bonus Exercise)

In 2018, we had the following triggers that are widely used in various CMS analyses.

Single electron (isolated): HLT_Ele32_WPTight_Gsf_v

Single electron (non-isolated): HLT_Ele115_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_v, HLT_Ele50_CaloIdVT_GsfTrkIdT_PFJet165_v

Double electron (loosely isolated): HLT_Ele23_Ele12_CaloIdL_TrackIdL_IsoVL_v

Double electron (non-isolated): HLT_DoubleEle25_CaloIdL_MW_v

Single photon: HLT_Photon200_v

Double photon: HLT_DoublePhoton70_v

For trigger efficiency (in 2017), see this: DP2018_030.pdf

We will now check e/gamma high level trigger rates for the run number 317683. Click on https://cmsoms.cern.ch/cms/triggers/hlt_rates. 
Input this run number, and click on a trigger name to view the trigger rate in Hz as a function of lumi-section. Also check the rate vs pile-up plots.

<br />%ICON{led-green}% Question: What was the average rate of HLT_Ele32_WPTight_Gsf_v trigger in this run?
<br />%ICON{led-green}% How does rate of HLT_Ele32_WPTight_Gsf_v depends on number of PU?

Now, for L1 rates, go to https://cmsoms.cern.ch/cms/triggers/l1_rates

Click on any egamma L1 trigger, eg. L1_SingleEG45er2p5, and check the rate w.r.t lumi section.

<br />%ICON{led-green}% Question: What is the average rate of this L1 trigger?
